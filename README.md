# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	
	Variables are placeholders you can set for values.  Kind of like nicknames.
	
	* Strings
	Strings are values surrounded by quotes.  These are usually sentences or words that are not variables and are created with the intention of interacting with the user in their native language.
	
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	Functions blocks of code you can program to carry out smaller tasks which contribute to your bigger one.  These can take arguments for their tasks or not, and as many as you want to pass them.  As part of their task, you can have them return a value to pass to another function.
	
	* `if` statements
	If statements help your functions distinguish between values and what you want to do with your results.
	
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
	Booleans can either be true or false.  These are useful in if statements.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
